Goodmorning everyone I'm divyansh and i welcome all of you to my presentation on the topic

SLIDE 2
Uses of Queue

SLIDE 3
First lets talk about queues
A queue is a foundational data structure used in programming applications.
It is an abstract data type or a linear data structure,
that stores the elements sequentially.
It uses the First In First Out or FIFO approach for accessing its elements.

SLIDE 4
now, what are the uses of queues?
some real life examples of queues are:-
lines at a ticket counter for a movie or a train
people standing on an escalator are also in a queue as the first person to step on the escalator will also be the first person to get off of the escalator.

Both of these examples run on the First In First Out mechanism

SLIDE 5
some applications of queues in computer science are

the working of a printer

priority queues for an operating system

Keyboard entries, let me explain this one, have you ever noticed that when your computer is under heavy load, it starts to lag and if you are typing something, the letters appear after a delay, but they are always in the order that we have typed them in. This works as the keys that we enter are stored in a queue and the CPU processes the input as it gets free.

other examples are

music players like spotify, which have a queue of songs that it will play for us one after the other

CPU scheduling
and
handling of website traffic
are other examples

Lets quickly summarise what all we have talked about in this presentation
queues are a linear data structure
they work on the First In First Out principle
Queues have a wide range of applications
Queues are very important even in our daily lives
Queues are an integral part of computer science and their importance is deeply felt.

That is all from my side
Have a great day ahead.
