Slide 1:
Goodmorning everyone and welcome to my presentation

Slide 2:
On the topic, CONDITIONAL EXECUTION AND LOOPS

Slide 3:
So what is conditional execution?
In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly.
Conditional statements give us this ability, By using boolean expressions
A boolean expression returns one of two values, true or false

the simplest form of conditional statements is thee if statement
an example is on the screen

Slide 4:
Now how to implement conditional execution?
to control the flow of our program we use conditional statements
in python we have three conditional statements
if
elif
and else
the boolean expression after the if statement is called the condition
and together they are known as conditionl statments
we use indentation in python to put code in the condition block
and this is a simple example of an if statement

Slide 5:
About nesting
in python we can use multiple if elif else statements under each other to get our desired output
Let me explain with this diagram.

Slide 6:
Enough about Conditional statements
Now lets talk about loops in python
What are loops?
Loops are used to run a block of code n number of times without having to write them repeatedly
they are very helpful to us
as they reduce the number of lines of code
and increase pproductivity and code readabilty

there are 2 types of loops in python
the for loop
and the while loop

for loops are used when the number of iterations or a range is known
whereas,
while loops are used when we dont necessarily know the number of iterations required and we want to run our code till a specific condition is met.

Slide 7:
Now Control statements and condional statements within loops
we can use conditional statements in loops to control its execution and get our desired output
in conjunction with loop control statements
like
continue and pass
also the iterator variable can be declared within the for loop but not in the while loop
let me explain with this sample code

Slide 8:
Lets quickly recap what we have learned through this presentation
we talked about conditional execution of loops and their importance
the different types of conditional statements, namely: if, elif and else
we talked about loops and their significance in our lives as coders
we saw the nesting of conditional statements and loops
and also using conditional statements within loops themselves using loop control statements.

i hope this presentation would have helped you understand these basic concepts of python language

slide 9:
And that, is all from my side.
